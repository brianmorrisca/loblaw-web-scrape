# Loblaw Web Scrape - Loblaws compared to No Frills

The goal of this notebook is to demonstrate the power of web scraping using open source tools available to everyone. As well as analyzing the grocery products of two popular stores, Loblaws and NoFrills.

Throughout this notebook, you will see how to scrape both grocery websites and different ways to compare the stores using data visualization techniques. We also target a specific case example by using the same shopping list at both stores and tracking its cost over the course of a week.

This scrape took place before, during, and after the Canadian Thanksgiving weekend. As such, it will be an example of grocery product inventory around a holiday weekend.
